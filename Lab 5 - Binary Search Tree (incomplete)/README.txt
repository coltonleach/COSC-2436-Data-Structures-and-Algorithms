This program is supposed to take in employee IDs and names, store them in a binary search tree,
and allow the user to search for an ID to see if it's in the tree.

This program doesn't actually do any of that. I could not figure out how to make a proper BST
while having the variables in a private class and the getters and setters. It was just too confusing.

I tried making a recursive method to add integers to the BST, but the program doesn't seem to actually
enter the recursive method. I was able to hard code them into the tree, but I doubt that's what you're expecting.
