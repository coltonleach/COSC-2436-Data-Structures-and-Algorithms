This program uses smart pointers and a linked list to
view text from a file, and remove duplicates from said file.
The three main functions are:
	addNode, removeduplicate, and displayList.
addNode: adds a node that will store a string value from the file.
removeDuplicate: removes duplicates that are in the file.
displayList: displays the linked list values.
