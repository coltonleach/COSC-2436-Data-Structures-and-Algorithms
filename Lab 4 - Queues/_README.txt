This program makes use of a queue.
It starts out with asking the user to choose a data type they would like to use.
Then a second menu displays giving the user the queue options (enqueue, dequeue, display, then back to the main menu).
enqueue: asks the user what they would like to put into the queue
dequeue: automatically removes the first entry in the queue, and displays what was removed, unless empty.
display: displays the entire queue, unless empty.
	For some reason I could not get the program to function properly with seperate IntQueue.cpp and IntQueue.h files.
	It only functioned properly when I had everything in the .h file.
