This program is about stack implamentation using an array.
The program asks the user if they would like to:
	check isEmpty, Push, Pop, Peek, or quit the program.
isEmpty checks whether or not the stack is empty.
Push allows the user to add to the stack. It asks for a item name, and a color. Both get added into a single index.
Pop allows the user to remove the top item from the stack.
Peek allows the user to see what is at the top of the stack.
